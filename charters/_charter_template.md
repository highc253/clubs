# Snek Club

*Last modified YYYY-MM-DD*

## Purpose

To identify, appreciate, and care for snake-related (visually, lexically,
metaphorically, or taxonomically) things.

## Membership

Anyone is welcome to attend our meetings and SNek Appreciation aCtivities
(SNACs). Additionally, we maintain a roster of members that regularly attend
club activities/are subscribed to our mailing list.

## Officers and Roles

Two officers manage Snek Club, a primary leader (known as the Tail) and a
secondary leader (known as the Head).

## Transition Protocol

In keeping with the concept of _ouroboros_, at the end of each year, the Head
"eats" the Tail, becoming the primary leader of the club (the Tail) and
fulfilling the circle of life and death. A new Head is chosen from the
membership at a candle-lit ceremony on the last full moon of the school year
through excellence voting of all attendees. If the former Head chooses not to
"eat" the Tail, a new Tail is chosen with the same process.

## Club Assets

  - the snek@lists.olin.edu mailing list
  - locked storage cabinet on the 4th floor of the AC (containing NO LIVE SNAKES)
  - various secret shrines in Parcel B

## Purchases

We generally purchase frozen mice, candles, and eggs on a regular basis.
Periodically (about once every two years) we'll probably need to augment our
long-term supplies of snakes costumes (both for people and snakes) plastic boxes
with breathing holes, and humane animal traps.

## Events and Activities

SNACs occur roughly every month, where members will share their latest
snek-related news and consume visually-snek-related confections. Daily
excursions are made to the locked closet on the fourth floor of the AC.

## Amendment Procedure

Anyone may propose an amendment to this charter with a pull request on GitHub or
by emailing the Head/Tail or any CCO director.
