# European Club
_Last modified 2018-9-7_

## Purpose
The purpose of European club is to build a community of people, at Olin and other Boston-area schools, with a shared interest in European topics and culture. 

## Membership
Membership is open to anyone interested in the club's purpose.

## Officers and Roles
The club consists of leaders and attendees.

Leaders are in charge of organizing events, communicating with and collecting input from attendees, communicating with other schools, and managing the budget. Those who would like a leadership position can apply by sending a short proposal by email to the current leaders.

Attendees attend the events and participate at their chosen level of involvement in community conversations.

## Transition Protocol
If in April all the current leaders are students graduating that year, the leaders should try to recruit successors from the attendee pool.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The club will issue funding requests for operational costs of our events. We anticipate events to be held in the dorms, in the crescent room (with proper reservation), and at other colleges.

## Events and Activities
Discussions, dinners, movies, guest speakers, etc.

## Amendment Procedure
If things don’t work, we’ll change our structure. Anyone who wants to participate in a respectful discussion surrounding those changes will be welcome.
