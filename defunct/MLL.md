*Last modified 2018-09-03*

## Purpose
The purpose of this club is to bring student-led machine learning research research to Olin. The club will support different speciailizations with teams of 3-5 leading each specialization. A specialization is an exploration whose goal is to create a unique paper.

## Membership
You are a member of MML if you actively participate in research with the club.

## Officers and Roles
Lab Director: The Lab Director's job is to coordinate the lab's different research teams and to help keep the club running smoothly.  The Lab Director can also be a research lead and has the same responsiblities as any other member.
Research Lead: A research lead is an individual who leads a research specialization of the club. There is no limit on the number of research leads. The research leads' jobs include scheduling meetings for their teams and making sure their teams are working and achieving goals in a timely manner.

## Transition Protocol
Lab Director: There will be a lab director vote at the conclusion of every year for the upcoming year.
Research Lead: A research lead will be determined whenever a new specialization is created within the club. 

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space
As needed, we can book an AC room, EH or a library team room. We do not currently intend on purchasing anything for the club, and our necessary materials will be our laptops. If we need more computing time/power, we will request DeepThought time; if this doesn't work we will instead attempt to use an online virtual machine and will use club money to help fund the time.

## Events and Activities
The club will host meetings for all research specializations weekly; individual specializations will meet more frequently, as determined by specialization.

## Amendment Procedure
This document can be amended by a majority vote of club members.
