# (H)ola
## Olin Latino Association - The H is Silent

## Purpose

To create, engage in, and support the inclusion of Latinx culture at Olin College campus. 

(H)OLA (Olin Latino Association - the H is silent) aims to achieve this purpose through planning, organizing, and hosting events that improve the educational and cultural awareness of the Olin community.

## Membership

(H)OLA membership is open for all who wish to join. In special cases, events may be held exclusively for the Latinx community, and (H)OLA asks that the larger Olin community respect these gatherings. The club, however, is intended to be inclusive for all with the intention to share Latinx culture.

## Officers and Roles

The club will have 2 head individuals responsible for planning meetings, sending e-mail, and leading club/event logistics. Having two head individuals ensures each event hosted by (H)OLA has a distributed workload and diversity in perspective.

## Transition Protocol

Towards the end of each academic year, the club will reflect on the current leadership structure, and decide on its effectiveness. A structure voted effective will be kept in place, and a structure voted ineffective will open the club to discuss and implement a new strategy for running the club. If a responsible individual resigns, they must designate someone to replace them, and at least one club leader should not be a senior to ensure longevity.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The club requires no immediate materials, but events will include items (food) that require purchasing. The club may request funding for transportation, food for events, and other miscellaneous items specific to events. Planning meetings will occur in the Campus Center or dorm lounges, and events may require using portions of Milas Hall or the Great Lawn.

## Events and Activities [tentative]

Regular meetings will be weekly or bi-weekly breakfast/dinner meetings intended for all to attend. Through growth of the club members diversity we, the student bodies running the club, are open to hosting events for specific Latinx countries and recognize our limitation of experience. 


A) 16 de Septiembre (9/16 or SLAC event 9/19)
	Empanadas and other Latinx desserts will be made and served to general Olin population to create connections with new Latinx students and other Latinx community members. 


B) Dia de los Muertos (11/2)
	Depending on availabilty of the student coordinators and resources (ie candy, altars, and related items to Dia de los Muertos) an event might be held to educate the community on this celebrate.

	This event is to celebrate and enjoy the work of members of the club with food. 


D) Cinco de Mayo (9/5)

Any member can propose an amendment at any time. If over half of the (H)OLA community agrees that change is needed, that change will be implemented.

In repetition, Community feedback and suggested events surrounding important events/dates will be taken into consideration.
