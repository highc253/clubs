# Interactive Robotics Laboratory
*Last modified 09-16-2018*

## Purpose

The Interactive Robotics Laboratory is a research team that allows students interested in software or robotics to explore the field of human-robot interactions. By giving students control over their own learning goals and enabling them to research and learn new topics, we accelerate and expose members to the vast knowledge in the world of robotics. Our tangible end product is a happy student who has felt like he/she has learned or accomplished something, and then a comprehensive demonstration of our semester's work at each Olin EXPO.

## Membership

Membership is open to everyone. Members are strongly encouraged to attend weekly meeting schedules, generally 8 hours a week. The club pushes for more hours than average because we have a history of producing better work and learning more when people put in more time. Of course, members can also just attend what they can, and their projects will be scoped according the time they can commit.

## Officers and Roles

The main role in IRL is that of project lead. The Project Leader is responsible for directing the overall project goal and guiding members to both achieve their personal learning goals and build towards a common end product. They should prefer to defer to club-wide opinions for important decision making, but also should be able to facilitate progress in the club and act as a point of authority. The Leader is also responsible for logistics, maintenance of the arms, and overall happiness of the team.

A member's role and involvement grows by taking initiative and being present. Any member is free to take on more responsibilities and assist the leader, or provide their feedback or opinions on certain items. The more work the member puts into their project and the more they are active in meeting proceedings, the more stake they have in the team.

## Transition Protocol

New club leaders are to be found and recognized between the second semester of junior year or the first semester of senior year for the existing leaders. The transition protocol should begin with initial verbal confirmation, followed by announcement to the team, followed by a slow transition of responsibilities from the existing leaders to the new ones over the course of a semester. A good official tradeoff point when the new leaders formally take on the position and the existing leaders retire to become gurus is EXPO signups.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

IRL is a fairly large research project team, and thus requires a steady supply of funding to function optimally. We generally will buy fairly expensive equipment and hardware for our robotic arms, such as sensors, props, new augmentations to the existing arms, etc. Most of these purchases will be done via robolab however, with perhaps a few coming from CCO.

Most of the requests as a club in CCO will be for snacks and planned club events. In an effort to improve quality of life while working 8 hours a week, the club hopes to do what it can to keep members happy and motivated.

## Events and Activities

IRL holds weekly meetings three times a week to work on projects. We may occasionally go out for team bonding if possible, such as a team dinner or a team outing to a nearby place.

Our major event would be our booth at EXPO, where we showcase our semester's worth of hard work to the public. We also participate in Robots, Teas, and Cookies, a weekly Friday event in the Olin RoboLab.

## Amendment Procedure

If things don’t work, we’ll change our structure.  Anyone who wants to participate in discussion surrounding those changes will be welcome.
