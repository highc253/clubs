**Purpose**

Some conversation topics rarely come up at Olin, so we want to create a safe space where discussions about possibly controversial or unusual topics are encouraged.

**Membership**

Anyone can attend a PopTalk (you can choose to attend one of them or all of them) and be a member. We have a membership group chat that we would love you to be a part of to stay in touch.

**Officers and Roles**

The coordination team consists of three people who maintain the club group chat and oversee the logistics. Additionally, any member may take on the role of facilitator and propose a PopTalk conversation topic to the group in advance. Facilitators are in charge of researching the topic a bit and presenting prompts for conversation (e.g. a video to start off the conversation and/or relevant questions).

**Transition Protocol**

If a member of the coordination team steps down, a new coordinator will be elected by a majority vote from the club membership. If a member wishes to be a coordinator and the club already has three active coordinators, the membership can vote to amend the procedures and add another coordinator if it chooses.

**Club Materials, Purchases, and Space**

Club funding goes towards buying popcorn and toppings for people to eat during PopTalks. Purchases may be made by the coordination team and other club members/facilitators with club spending training.

**Procedures**

PopTalks are held bi-monthly, but the day of week and time can vary according to the wishes of the coordinators and facilitators. PopTalks should have an appropriate amount of structure (this can vary for different topics), but in general the facilitator(s) should have some discussion prompts ready to keep the conversation moving.

**PopTalk Conversation Guidelines**

As the topics discussed at PopTalks are generally controversial, personal, or delicate in some way, we ask that you help us maintain a welcoming environment for all participants:

- Share your thoughts from an &quot;I&quot; perspective instead of saying &quot;we&quot; or &quot;you&quot;
- Be respectful of ideas even if you do not agree
- Listen to others and be mindful of how much you talk (we want to give everyone a chance to speak up if they want to)

**Amendment Procedures**

In order to amend club procedures, the amendment in question must be presented to all active club members and pass by a majority vote. The new procedure will take place immediately unless otherwise specified.
