## Purpose
Olin Aero is an organisation that seeks to enable students to develop their understanding of, and passion for Aerial systems. Aero also aims to support all aerial vehicle teams on Olin's campus to help them attend competition.

## Membership
Membership to Aero is open to anyone, and Aero will aim to support any new projects proposed. Aero's sub-teams (DBF, IARC, etc) are allowed to make teaming decisions at their discretion, and are responsible for running their respective teams.

## Officers and Roles
Aero will begin this year with a President, who is in charge of the mailing list and finances. The President will begin a transition process to transfer operations of Aero to either another president, or an executive council immediately. This process will be completed some time in the spring semester.

## Transition Protocol
The transition will be lead by the Aero President. All appointments to roles suceeding the president (future President or executive council) will be made by the current president.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Aero maintained an LPB space last year, and will endeavour to maintain a similar LPB space this year. This space is used for storage and vehicle construction. Expenditure for this year will include Materials for aerial vehicles, fees for competition participation, and travel to said competitions.

## Events and Activities
Aero sub-teams hold weekly all-hands and work meetings where they work on their individual projects. Aero leadership will meet with sub-team leadership regularly to ensure open communication.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a majority vote from the executive team, the charter will be amended, and the revised version will be sent to the SAC clubs and Orgs chair.
