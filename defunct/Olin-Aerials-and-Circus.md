# Olin Aerials and Circus
*Last modified 2018-09-10*

## Purpose
- Expose students to the wide world of circus and aerial arts, which a lot of people don’t even know is something they can be involved in
- Give students the opportunity to expand their comfort zone, work on fun and exciting physical skills, and support wellness through physical activity
- Provide consistent, reliable transportation to off-campus circus facilities

## Membership
Members should commit to attending class regularly. Obviously it’s fine to miss a week here and there with conflicts, but attending a weekly evening class is recommended for skill maintenance. It is also fine to stay on our club list and attend one-off events without participating in the weekly classes.

## Officers and Roles
The President will have the final decision in matters, and the responsibility of scheduling classes and transportation for the rest of the members.  But we believe in a very flat leadership structure and all members should feel empowered to suggest changes, make decisions, and take on leadership for events and activities.

## Transition Protocol
At the end of the year, the President must designate a successor, with nominations and votes from other club members, who will take on continuing the club for the next year.

## Club Materials
Paying for a portion of each students’ cost of classes.  Members will be expected to cover the remainder of their class cost that the club cannot cover.  It is the wish of the club that members be able to participate regardless of their ability to pay, and that exceptions for coverage of fees may be possible on a member-by-member basis.

## Events and Activities
- Weekly classes
- On-campus workouts, if members are interested
- One-off events
- End-of-semester show at Expo

## Amendment Procedure
Any member may propose an amendment, to be discussed among the club, and any member may give feedback or opinion on the proposed amendment.  If the proposer of the amendment believes it to be non-trivial, the President may approve it.  Otherwise, a vote will be cast among all club members.
