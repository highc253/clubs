# Outing Club
*Last modified 2018-09-05*

## Purpose
Facilitate Olin student enjoyment of the great outdoors through organizing camping and hiking trips, as well as providing a stock of gear for Olin students to borrow and use.

## Membership
By some definitions, the entire school -- anyone can borrow our equipment or go on our trips.

## Officers and Roles:
Tsar:  Makes sure things happen, and generally keeps an eye on the gear room.  Usually assisted by a few excited and outdoorsy Oliners in handling logistics, but there's no other official officer-ship.
Vice-Tsar: Same as Tsar, but less respect.

## Transition Protocol
Either held for another year or assigned in May by outgoing president to another Olin student who has demonstrated interest in the outdoors.  If the Tsar is a senior, they are strongly encouraged to nominate a VT who is not a senior for knowledge transfer.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Storage space shared with Adventure Club and SCUBA club in WH2W.  We own several tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, etc. that are open for student body use.

## Events and Activities
The beginning-of-the-year camping trip, spring ski trip, and possible occasional events throughout.

## Amendment Procedure
We're a dictatorship.  Whatever the Dear Leader wishes.
