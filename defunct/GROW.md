*Last modified 2018-10-9*

## Purpose
GROW is a student collective for making the world a more environmentally sustainable place. We meet weekly for dinner discussions and project check-ins. GROW will also strive to encourage other community members to be more thoughtful in their actions by encouraging sustainable choices.GROW will support multiple projects based on interests of members.

## Membership
GROW has an open membership policy and encourages interested students to attend weekly meetings, in order to ensure progress in GROW's projects. We strive to have as many people at the discussions and projects as possible. The goal is to get everyone thinking about living sustainably.

## Officers and Roles
There will be one or two Club Leaders who will organize meetings and coordinate between project teams, Olin facilities, and external groups. Each project will be led by one or two Project Leaders.

## Transition Protocol
The current Club Leaders will choose the new Club Leaders such that there is always a non-graduating student as a Club Leader. Senior members will take advising roles.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
Funding will come from Club Funding for events and Green Initiatives for larger projects, as well as other sources. Funding requests will be submitted by the Club or Project Leaders.

## Events and Activities
GROW will meet weekly for interesting discussions, check-ins, and brainstorming during dinner, at which time project leaders will give updates about projects and receive feedback from the rest of the club. There will also be opportunities to attend sustainability-themed events.

## Amendment Procedure
There must be a consensus among club members to approve a change. Club members must strive to achieve consensus by being proactive, reasonable, and flexible.
