# Purpose

To provide Olin staff whose primary language is not English, opportunities on campus to develop English language skills. 

The main focus of this club will be on conducting weekly classes. The club will also work to provide access to resources like ESOL books to Olin community members.  

# Membership

Membership is open to any student who wishes to either help run or prepare classes. New members will be required to undergo training. Students who are unable to stay engaged long term but are able to volunteer occasionally are still encouraged to be members. However, such students will only be able to assist trained members and will not be allowed to handle classes on their own. 

# Officers and Roles

This club will have two leaders to coordinate classes, organize training and manage spending. 

# Transition Protocol

At the end of each year all members will have a discussion and choose two new leaders based on group consensus. Leaders should be able and willing to commit a minimum of four hours every week.   

# Club Materials, Purchases and Space

Classes will be conducted in the conference room in the campus center. 

Club funding will be used to purchase ESOL workbooks and classroom supplies. Occasionally, club funding might also be used to purchase food. However, the bulk of the funding will be reserved to bring in trainers to train students on how to teach ESOL. 

# Events and Activities

Depending on the number of Olin staff interested, the number of weekly classes will be determined. 

# Amendment Procedure

Any club member or Olin community member is free and encouraged to propose amendments at any point.
