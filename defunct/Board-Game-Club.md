# Board Game Club
*Last modified 2018-09-07*
## Purpose 
The goal of this club is to set up times and events during which people can play board games with others, to manage the board games Olin owns, and to buy new board games.
## Membership
Anyone can be a member, and there are no official criteria for membership. Members can vote on proposed amendments to the charter. It is suggested members sign up for the Board Game Club mailing list as this is how members are contacted, and amendments to the charter are proposed.
## Officers and Roles
The heads of Board Game Club are known as the "Board Game Presidents." There are two Presidents, one who lives in West Hall and one who lives in East Hall. The Board Game Presidents manage the mailing list, have the final say on club decisions and may appoint a cabinet or subcommittee to help with logistical issues such as purchases or advertisement as they see fit. The West Hall president will be responsible for organizing and hosting events in West Hall, and the East Hall president will be responsible for events in East Hall. Other events are the responsibility of both presidents.
## Transition Protocol
In the month of April, the Board Game President must designate a successor, who will take over immediately until the end of the next school year. At that time, the new Board Game President will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has occurred.
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We have various types of games stored in WH2 cubby on the west side of the lounge and EH1 cubby left of the TV. Students can use the games at any time. Throughout the year we will need to purchase new games as well as snacks for events. Events will be hosted in public locations on campus such as dorm lounges.

Board game purchases are ultimately up to the discretion of the presidents, but the opinion of the club as a whole should be solicited via surveys before purchases are made (e.g. send a survey asking "what board games do you want us to buy?" to collect suggestions, then "these are the board games we're considering, which ones should we buy?" to help make final decisions.
## Events and Activities
We will hold board game nights which will have snacks for participants.
## Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership (polled via the mailing list; 50% of respondent members must approve of the amendment), it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the Director of Clubs and Organizations.
