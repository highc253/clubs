Membership is open to everyone.

## Officers and Roles
CDAT has a president that is responsible for purchasing materials for the club, managing the mailing list, and organizing supply storage.

## Transition Protocol
The new president of CDAT will be decided in April of each year my majority consensus.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
CDAT supplies will be stored on the library first floor. Funding will primarily go to materials used to ideate and make murals. Funding will also be needed to keep the closet supplied with adequate materials and replace them when needed. Finally, funding will be used for gallery materials on rare occasions. 

## Events and Activities
We will host meetings in which ideas for murals can be ideated as well as occasional art making study breaks. We will also update the gallery monthly and eventually meet to make the mural itself. 

## Amendment Procedure
Any member may propose an amendment to the club charter. If a proposed amendment has over 50% support through active members in the club, that amendment is passed and incorporated into the charter.
