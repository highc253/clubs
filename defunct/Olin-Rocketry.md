# Olin Rocket Club Charter

## Purpose
The goal of Olin Rocketry is to conceive, design, manufacture, and fly competition sounding rockets.

## Membership
The team itself is part of AERO at Olin. To become a member of the team, any student may interview into a specific subsystem team. The
club will provide information on those subsystems to potential new members.

## Officers
The team is divided into different subsystems required for rocket design. As of 9/7/18 the
subsystems are: Avionics, Structures and Recovery, and Engines and Chemistry. The
Subsystems are headed by subsystem leads who are advised and guided by the
Systems Engineer. The Project Manager is in charge of the Systems Engineer and the
club’s health and administrative standing in general. The Project Manager is the primary
contact for the team (aka president).

## Transition Protocol
The team shall go through voting procedure before the end of the final assessments
period of the Spring semester. For the following procedure it is assumed that all
graduating seniors are unavailable for election (because they will be gone).
* *Subsystem Leads Election Process*
Members of the subsystems will vote to elevate one of their own to the position of
subsystem lead for their particular subsystem (e.g. Avionics will chose an Avionics lead
for the next year). The person elected to be subsystem lead can be vetoed however by
an agreement between the current Project Manager and Systems Engineer. This can be
overturned with a unanimous vote by all current subsystem leads. 
* *Project Manager and Systems Engineer Election Process*
All current subsystem leads, the current Project Manager, and the current Systems
Engineer may nominate any one member of the team to the position of Project Manager
and Systems Engineer respectively. These same people then vote on the nominees
(pending the nominee accepts the nomination).

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space
The team will utilize space in AC426 for storage purposes. Any purchases will come out of Olin Rocketry's account inside of AERO.


## Events and Activities
The team shall meet as a whole at the discretion of the Project Manager. Meetings will happen on a weekly basis.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments may be proposed by the Subsystem Leads, System Engineer, and Project
Manager. Upon a proposition a vote will take place involving the Leads, SysE, and Project Manager. The amendment is passed with a simple majority vote.

## Safety
The team’s safety manual shall be the ultimate authority on machining, chemistry, and
launch operations. It too, like this document, shall go through the amendment
procedures outlined above. Any person, both in the team and out of the team, shall be
able to request and receive the current edition of the safety manual promptly.
