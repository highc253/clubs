# CRAFT Club
## Purpose

To provide an organized time and environment where students can work on any crafting type projects. 

## Membership

Anyone can attend a CRAFT (Create Radically Amazing Fabricated Thingamabobs) club meeting (you can choose to attend one of them or all of them) and be a member. We have a membership group chat and a mailing list that we would love you to be a part of to stay in touch.

## Officers and Roles

The President of CRAFT club manages the mailing list and group chat. They also submit requests for additional equipment. Additionally, any member may take on the role of a coordinator and propose an optional craft of the day for a meeting. Coordinators are in charge of researching the craft and organizing the activity.

## Transition Protocol

The current president must select their successor (in whatever way they feel appropriate) before they leave Olin.

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space

Members may borrow materials for meetings or personal use. All items should be returned as soon as possible so that as many groups as possible may use them. Club storage is located in the WH3 lounge closet. We can submit funding requests for additional craft supplies. Please let the club president know if you have any requests.

## Procedures

CRAFT meetings are held weekly. CRAFT club meetings are rather informal and you can come and go as your schedule allows. You are free to come and work on your own projects or to work on the craft of the day (If there is one that day).

## Amendment Procedures

In order to amend club procedures, the amendment in question must be presented to all active club members and pass by a majority vote. The new procedure will take place immediately unless otherwise specified.
