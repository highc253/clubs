# Club Name: Wine   Club
Last Updated: 8/31/17

## Purpose
The purpose of our club is to educate 21+ members of the Olin community on fine wines and other craft beverages through formal tastings.

## Membership
Because this club will conduct tastings of wine and other craft beverages, membership will be restricted to those 21 and older. While membership is open to all students 21 and over, we will ask members to RSVP to specific events in order for us to purchase the right amount of wine and to keep track of who is at each event.

## Officers and Roles
The club leadership will consist of 2-3 members who will be responsible for organizing events and purchasing materials needed.

## Transition Protocol
A transition protocol will take place if an underclassman who is over 21 years of age expresses interest in taking over the club and maintaining both its integrity as a fine wine tasting club and the responsibilities that come along with a club of this nature (i.e. rigorous screening). Club leadership will be responsible for the process.

## Club Materials, purchases, and space
Events will be hosted in East Hall, most likely in a suite with closed doors, or a controlled lounge space. We will purchase some tasting glasses, and fine wines from around the world. Funding will be requested for each individual event, and will be based off of the number of people RSVPâ€™d for the event.

## Events and Activities
We plan to conduct several formal wine tastings with light food pairings throughout the semester. In addition we may do other craft beverage tasting events.

## Amendment Procedures
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment meets a favorable response and is supported by the leadership it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the CCO.
