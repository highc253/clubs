# MAGMA
Make A Game, Make Assets
Last Modified 9/7/2018

## Purpose
To unite people with a shared interest in game development or interactive
programming through game jams.

## Membership
Anyone can be a member, no prior experience is needed. There will be a
mailing list containing all members to announce upcoming events, and all
who are interested may join any event and become a member of the club.

## Officers and Roles
(El/La/Elle/Lo) Presidente - The person in charge of organizing events,
securing spaces, and club finances. Pronoun is determined by the person
upon entering the role and may be changed at any time, however it must
be a Spanish pronoun.
Other roles will be added as needed.

## Transition Protocol
El Presidente may choose their successor (if this successor accepts), or
may choose to hold a vote. Voters must have participated in at least one
club sponsored event and must be attending Olin College the following
year. The person who receives the most votes and has attended at least
one event becomes the new Presidente if they choose to accept. If they do
not accept the nomination, the person who receives the next most votes is
nominated and may choose to accept the nomination. This process
continues until a nominee accepts their role as Presidente. If no nominee is
chosen, the entire process is repeated until a Presidente is chosen.

## Materials, Purchases, and Spaces
The club requires a common space (typically the computer lab) for
members to participate in game jams. Purchases are made by the current
Presidente.

## Events and Activities
Game jams. This can include Ludum Dare, the One Hour Game Jam, etc.

## Amendment Procedure
Amendments may be ratified by the currently residing Presidente or a
majority vote of members who have attended the previous event.
Amendments may be proposed by any member that has attended at least
one club event.
