# Olin Sailing Team

## Purpose
Provide opportunities for Olin students to sail competitively in College Sailing Conferences.

## Membership
Sailing Team Members are encouraged to attend the 2 practices we have per week and will be invited to weekend events subject to available transportation, based on skill and attendance.

## Officers and Roles
Jeff Dusek will be designated as the coach and will be the principal decision maker.

All other members will have the power to voice suggestions to Jeff which he may or may not accept.

Captains include but are not necessarily limited to Andrew Schnurr, Colin Snow, Thomas Jagielski, and Sander Miller.

## Transition Protocol
As long as Jeff is willing to be the coach, he will be the coach. If Jeff leaves, other arrangements will be made by Jeff.

Captains will be voted upon by popular vote, or appointed by Jeff each year at the beginning of the fall season.

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space
We will sail on Lake Waban with the Wellesley college sailing club.

All purchases will be approved by Jeff, will be for the benefit of the team, and will promote the growth and continuation of the sailing program.

## Events and Activities
We will primarily attend events sponsored by the New England Interscholastic Sailing Association, or its larger association, the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association.

Transportation to these events will either be arranged through Wellesley or by Jeff.

## Amendment Procedure
1. Propose an amendment to Jeff Dusek
2. Jeff can either approve the amendment or not
3. If everyone disagrees with Jeff, we will tell Jeff and hope he agrees.
