# Olin Hackathon Club
*Last modified Aug 18 2018*
## Purpose
To encourage, support, and provide a community for Oliners interested in attending, facilitating, and being involved with hackathons and hackathon culture.
## Membership
Any student even vaguely interested in hackathons is welcome to join. Those who are on the hackathon email list are welcome to continue using that resource if that is a medium they prefer, but they are welcome to join our group as well - we will occasionally leverage the list to advertise resources and events.
## Officers and Roles
There will be a group of several hackathon enthusiasts keeping track of upcoming events and opportunities. Interested members can feel free to take point on specific events.
## Transition Protocol
At the end of each school year, the club should reflect on whether or not the current leadership structure has been effective - if it is, keep it in place, and if it is not, discuss and implement a new way of running the club. In general, however, if a leader resigns they should designate someone to replace them, and at least one club leader should not be a senior to ensure longevity. 
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The club needs no materials for now, but it will request funding for transportation to events within reasonable cost (most events will likely be far away enough that transportation has a cost, but not so far away that it is a huge expense). As for space, informal planning meetings will probably occur during SLAC. 
## Events and Activities
Attending hackathons in the area, volunteering at/facilitating hackathons, teaching each other hackathon skills such as how to use various software libraries or how to eat the most pizza in the shortest amount of time. The group will also seriously work towards the possibility of hosting hackathons and similar events. 
## Amendment Procedure
Any member can propose an amendment at any point - if over half the club agrees that a change is needed, that change will be implemented.
