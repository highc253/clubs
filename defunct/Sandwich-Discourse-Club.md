# Olin Sandwich Discourse Club 
*Last modified Aug 18 2018*
## Purpose
To discuss important matters in the Olin community pertaining to the rigorous definition of sandwich and related concepts.
## Membership
Any student who (clearly) understands the definition of a sandwich or is interested in learning more is more than welcome to join.
## Officers and Roles (Bread Rolls)
There are a few toastmasters who run the club and are default meeting facilitators, but any member who has a topic to propose is welcome to run a meeting.
## Transition Protocol
The toastmasters should designate replacements at the end of the academic year if they are a senior or if change is necessary.
## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The club may provide sandwiches? at some events, and may require funding or request contributions from members depending on sandwich demand. 
## Events and Activities
Meet regularly to discuss sandwiches, often during SLAC. Also reach out to the Olin community to provide a vehicle for discussion. 
## Amendment Procedure
Any member can propose an amendment at any point - if over half the club agrees that a change is needed, that change will be implemented as soon as possible.
