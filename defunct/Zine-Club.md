# Zine Club
Last updated February 6, 2019

## Purpose
Create a platform for teaching, learning, making, and collaborating on zines, which are DIY magazines or books created to ask questions or share ideas.

## Membership
Anyone can join, as long as they follow our code of conduct. We will hold meetings weekly or biweekly depending on demand, and anyone is welcome, but you can be a member without attending meetings.

## Officers and Roles
We are a decentralized collective. The point person and budget tracker will be self-selected volunteers, who may be the same person. The budget tracker must be spending trained. They will be listed in this document. The point person is responsible for updating the website, and can share this responsibility with others.

- Current point person for questions: [Sam Daitzman](mailto:sdaitzman@olin.edu)
- Current budget tracker: [Arwen Sadler](mailto:asadler@olin.edu)

## Transition Protocol
The current point person and budget trackers are consensus-based and can be changed at any time, but should be changed approximately once per year. The current point person must have access to the website’s admin panel, and must share it with the next point person or transfer access.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Spaces
The club’s possessions at its founding consist of one modified long-handled stapler. The budget tracker will draw up a budget, which must contain all purchases. Funding will be spent on zine-making supplies (e.g. glossy paper, yarn, staples), printing, travel, conference fees, and food for meetings. Any member who is spending may submit a purchase request with prior agreement from the budget tracker, but it is recommended that the budget tracker make most or all purchase requests for the sake of organization. The budget will also cover the https://zines.fun domain going forward. The website will be used to coordinate resources and share some of our zines with the world.

## Events and Activities
We meet weekly or bi-weekly depending on interest and availability. We will do our best to maintain our current meeting time, which is Saturday 11am. Our meetings will be a place to propose ideas, work on zines, help each other, and share interesting zine work with each other. If there is interest, we will also attend conferences and fairs about or pertaining to zines like the New York Tech Zine Fair.

## Amendment procedure
Any change in leadership or other amendments to the charter must be consensus-based and must be initiated by a request for comment. Once any changes have been made, the new charter must be pushed to GitHub immediately.

## Code of Conduct
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our club a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. That means:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Taking action whenever these principles are not being followed
