# Olin Pit Masters
*Last modified 2018-09-03*

## Purpose

The purpose of Olin Pitmasters (OP) is to provide a place for Oliners to learn about grilling and smoking meats and other foods, as well as to feed the hungry Olin population with these meats and other foods. Club meetings will involve learning how to be a pitmaster through experience and eating.

## Membership

Membership will be defined as all members of the OP mailing list, though all members of the Olin community are welcome to attend OP events.

## Officers and Roles

The leadership team will be made up of all interested students.

## Transition Protocol

Upon graduation, the leadership team will designate a new leader for the Olin Pitmasters.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

OP will purchase a smoker, as well as fuel for both the smoker and the grill. For cooking events, they will also purchase meats and other foods. Meetings will be held in the grill area between the dorms.

## Events and Activities

The leadership team will run cooking events and train people on the smoker.

## Amendment Procedure

Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment is approved by the OP leadership team, the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair.
