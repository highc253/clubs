# Olin Jazz Orchestra (OJO)
*Last Modified 09-07-2018*

## Purpose

OJO is a club for people that want be a part of a big band at Olin. We will play both classic and contemporary big band music.

## Membership

Membership is open to everyone, although it may be restricted if the band gets too big (or broken up into several, smaller bands). Members are required to attempt learning songs, and to show up to band practices with a willingness to improve.

## Officers and Roles

There will only be one role on the team and that is the club leader. They are responsible for managing purchases and ensuring that everyone knows when to meet.

## Transition Protocol

In April, the new club leader will be selected who will guide the next year's band. The club leader will have the power to decide who leads the band next, but will take input from other members.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

Club members are responsible for providing their own instruments.

Sheet music will be purchased by the club, and will be responsibility of the club leader.

The space used by the club will either be the Jam Room in the Campus Center, or one of the practice rooms in East Hall.

## Events and Activities

OJO holds a weekly band-practice in the Jam Room, which every member of OJO must attend. There will also be sectional practices (such as rhythm section or wind section) that members of each sectional must attend. Every member is also expected to practice and learn their instrument outside of these times.

The club will also have at least one concert which is open for anyone to attend.

## Amendment Procedure

If members of OJO are unsatisfied with how the club is being run, or the rules, they are open to being amended. More than half of the members must vote in approval of a change for that change to happen.
